      <p>
        I love DIY crafts of all kinds. I draw and paint in a lot of mediums. I love Martial Arts and have a second degree black belt 
        in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo">Tae Kwon Do.</a></br>I also love music and play the drums. I have an 11 piece 
        drumset that I hop on every once in awhile. I also have two Congo African Grey parrots</br>that I have 
        raised from birth.

            These boys just turned 15 on the 4th of January. I've had them since they were 3-4 weeks old. They talk just like you and I. 
            They know how to count, their ABC's and colors. They will ask to watch a movie, and their favorite ones are Rio, Cars, Stewart 
            Little and anything to do with American Idol. They also pray for everything and everyone before going to bed at night.

            A drummer walks into a music shop with intentions of buying a new instrument. He has a look around and eventually 
            says to the attendant “I quite fancy that red trumpet and that massive accordion.”, to which the attendant 
            replies “You can have the fire extinguisher, but the radiator has to stay.”
